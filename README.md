This project is a full-stack Employee Management System built using React for the frontend, Spring Boot for the backend, and MySQL as the relational database. It provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing employee details via RESTful APIs.

In building this full-stack web application, I used:
- React for crafting the frontend, leveraging hooks like useState and useEffect to manage dynamic state and side effects. React Router was implemented for smooth navigation across components, and Bootstrap enhanced the styling and responsiveness of the UI.
- Spring Boot to develop the backend, where I designed RESTful APIs to handle employee CRUD operations. Using Spring Data JPA simplified database interactions and allowed seamless integration between entities and repositories.
- MySQL as the relational database to store employee records. The schema included fields like ID, name, department, email, and contact number, all connected to the backend via JPA annotations and configured through application.properties.
- Postman to test and debug REST endpoints, verifying request-response cycles and ensuring smooth API functionality.
